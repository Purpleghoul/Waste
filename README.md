# Skip Hire Web App

## Overview
This project is a modern, production-grade skip hire web application built with React and Vite. It delivers a clean, responsive, and professional user experience for selecting and booking skip containers online.

## Approach

### Design Principles
- **Minimalist, Intuitive UI:** The interface is visually clean, bright, and accessible, with a focus on clarity and ease of use.
- **Responsive Layout:** All components adapt seamlessly to desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.
- **Professional UX:** The app uses a stepper sidebar, visual skip selection, and clear summaries to guide users through the booking process.
- **Visual Feedback:** Selection states, tooltips, and eco badges provide immediate, accessible feedback.

### Architecture
- **React + Vite:** Fast, modular, and maintainable codebase with TypeScript support.
- **Component Structure:** UI is broken into reusable, self-documenting components for skip selection, filtering, stepper navigation, and summary.
- **API Integration:** Skip data is fetched from a real API, ensuring up-to-date information and easy extensibility.
- **State Management:** Local state is managed with React hooks for simplicity and performance.

### Code Quality
- **Production-Grade:** All code is optimized for readability, maintainability, and performance.
- **No Technical Debt:** Strict adherence to DRY and KISS principles, with zero redundant or speculative code.
- **Self-Documenting:** Descriptive naming and clear structure eliminate the need for comments or boilerplate.
- **Accessibility:** Keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, and color contrast are considered throughout.
